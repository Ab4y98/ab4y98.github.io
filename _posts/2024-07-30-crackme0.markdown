This is the first in a three-part series of Majorsopa's CrackMe challenges. The first challenge is fairly easy to solve, so let’s dive in and get started.

So...

Are you ready for your first challenge?

We begin by downloading the exe file from the challenge web page:  [Download Link](https://crackmes.one/crackme/65446e720f4238b24302b41c).

After downloading the challenge, we firstly execute it, then we load it into Ghidra and begin our analysis.

Next, we need to locate the main function.

Ghidra doesn’t always take us directly to it, so we have to find it manually.
I usually use the `"Search Program Text"` feature to search for specific text that can help me identify where I am in the code.

Here, we can see where this string is being used in the program:

And now we are in the main function as you can clearly see:

By examining the code, it's easy to spot that a string is being compared using `strcmp`. This is likely our input—perhaps it’s the correct password?

Well... as you can clearly see, that was the correct password.

Hopefully you didn’t find this challenge difficult, because we’re now moving on to [Crackme1](https://ab4y98.github.io/crackme1).
